Milo by Shel Silverstein

Milo loves me,
Milo cares,
Milo picks me peaches and pears.
Milo offers me candy and Cokes,
Milo listens and laughs at me jokes.
Milo helps when I get in a fight,
Milo does all my homework at night.
Milo misses me,
Milo cries,
Milo thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Milo is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Milo just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Milo's hand,
In the darkness where Milo usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Milo's gone!
